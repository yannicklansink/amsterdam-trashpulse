# TrashPulse Amsterdam

A live city radar for Amsterdam that visualizes afval-frictie: map, ticker, and pressure scoreboards.

## What this is
TrashPulse combines public Amsterdam datasets for waste-related reports and container locations to surface hotspots, trends, and operational backlog.

## Data sources
- Meldingen openbare ruimte (MORA / SIA)
- Huishoudelijk afval: containers + weeggegevens

See `PLAN.md` for the product brief, endpoints, and MVP scope.

## Quick start (planned)
This repo will host a Next.js app with MapLibre and a minimal API layer. Setup instructions will be added once the scaffold lands.
